# Phoshell
- Phoshell: a Forth inspired, extremely lightweight, stack machine shell, implementable in _ALL_ known programming languages.

Shell is supposed to simplify things (what things?), but most programmers thought that shell is a huge mysterious beast like Bash which is beyond the reach of common mortals. Thanks to Unix GNU?

- Perhaps the biggest mystery in the short history of computer programming?
  - Have `dc` and Forth programmers ever corssed path?

First Unix shell is reverse polish.
