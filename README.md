# Phoshell
- Phoshell: a Forth inspired, extremely lightweight, stack machine shell, implementable in _ALL_ known programming languages.

We do not know what we do not know. When someone tells us something we do not know, half the time we reject it.

Stack machine shell ("smashlet" or "shellet") is such a blind spot amongst programmers. Each and every word in the phrase "stack machine shell" is such fundamental concept that no one will think twice about it. But when chained together, the top Google search result is actually a Reddit post linked to another old repository by this GitHub user (udexon) &mdash; which means we have suceeded in defining this term.

This blind spot amongst programmers is so serious that we may use the Baby Elephant Syndrome or Chained Elephant Syndrome to describe it. It concerns two of the biggest controversies in computer programming:

- Diversification of Programming Languages
- Separation of CLI and GUI

To TLDR the long story:

- Is it possible to unify all programming languages with a universal script?
- Is it possible to create a CLI shell that can program GUI interactively?

We illustrate how stack machine shell resolves these issues by using Jitsi-Meet as example.

Simplifying React Redux Augmented Reality Programming (Jitsi Meet) using Forth derived Stack Machine Shell
Functionalities of code become more complex. Can code be made simpler at the same time? 

Another misconception: GUI and CLI are unrelated. However GUI is related to graph structure, and therefore Reverse Polish Notation.


Compare Smashlet to Redux, both in footprint and architecture. 

Jitsi Meet is field tested, large scale, 100 mb in zip size ... one of the biggest project of any kind, Redux , besides libreoffice. Merge all apps with Phoshell? With all platform module: web, Android, iOS. Active developments, how many commits per week, consistently? 



Shell is supposed to simplify things (what things?), but most programmers thought that shell is a huge mysterious beast like Bash which is beyond the reach of common mortals. Thanks to Unix GNU?

Subconcious conditioning, like the little elephant in the circus. Trained not to escape, tied to a pole. When grown up, also not espcaping.

- Perhaps the biggest mystery in the short history of computer programming?
  - Have `dc` and Forth programmers ever corssed path?

Other RP camps? Algol Unilever Burroughs?

HP calculators?

Other RP engineers?

First Unix shell is reverse polish.

Unix claimed the high ground for shell and programming language tools. Forth lost out. Making a comeback.
