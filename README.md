# Phoshell
- Phoshell: a Forth inspired, extremely lightweight, stack machine shell, implementable in _ALL_ known programming languages.

We do not know what we do not know. When someone tells us something we do not know, half the time we reject it.

Stack machine shell ("smashlet" or "shellet") is such a blind spot amongst programmers. Each and every word in the phrase "stack machine shell" is such fundamental concept that no one will think twice about it. But when chained together, the top Google search result is actually a Reddit post linked to another old repository by this GitHub user (udexon) &mdash; which means we have suceeded in defining this term.

This blind spot amongst programmers is so serious that we may use the Baby Elephant Syndrome or Chained Elephant Syndrome to describe it. It concerns two of the biggest controversies in computer programming:

- Diversification of Programming Languages and Frameworks
- Separation of CLI and GUI

To TLDR the long stories:

- Is it possible to unify all programming languages with a universal script?
- Is it possible to create a CLI shell that can program GUI interactively?

What are the problems we are trying to solve?

1. The good old learning curve to pick up a new framework / programming language (JavaScript React Redux).

2. Lack of a powerful live debugging system like Forth for new programmers to debug and learn the internal workings of Jitsi.

3. Both reasons above contribute to lack of documentation and manpower to prepare documentation, which lead to a positive feedback in difficulties in getting more developers.

Hence we hope R3ML will overcome these problems, perhaps enable thousands more developers to join our effort &mdash; ___Phoom: an augmented reality conferencing app___. 

The 3 problems mentioned above are not unique to Jitsi. They are perhaps generic to many other free software / open source projects.

We illustrate how stack machine shell resolves these issues by using Jitsi-Meet as example.

Phoshell is derived from the Forth programming language, as we took critical features from Forth and simplify them, to create a highly portable stack machine shell that can be implemented in around 50 lines of JavaScript code or equivalent, that essentially does the following:
- pushes non-function words (tokens) on to the stack;
- executes function words and pushes the results on to the stack.

Phoshell was initially implemented in PHP as an experiment to see how easy it is to implement a simplified stack machine. Eventually, we realized that this simplified stack machine can in fact be implemented in ___any known programming language___ _with the equivalent of around 50 lines of JavaScript or PHP code_, thus making the Forth like script (hence _"Phos"_) a likely candidate to be a ___universal scripting language___.

Simplifying React Redux Augmented Reality Programming (Jitsi Meet) using Forth derived Stack Machine Shell
Functionalities of code become more complex. Can code be made simpler at the same time? 

Another misconception: GUI and CLI are unrelated. However GUI is related to graph structure, and therefore Reverse Polish Notation.


Compare Smashlet to Redux, both in footprint and architecture. 

Jitsi Meet is field tested, large scale, 100 mb in zip size ... one of the biggest project of any kind, Redux , besides libreoffice. Merge all apps with Phoshell? With all platform module: web, Android, iOS. Active developments, how many commits per week, consistently? 



Shell is supposed to simplify things (what things?), but most programmers thought that shell is a huge mysterious beast like Bash which is beyond the reach of common mortals. Thanks to Unix GNU?

Subconcious conditioning, like the little elephant in the circus. Trained not to escape, tied to a pole. When grown up, also not espcaping.

- Perhaps the biggest mystery in the short history of computer programming?
  - Have `dc` and Forth programmers ever corssed path?

Other RP camps? Algol Unilever Burroughs?

HP calculators?

Other RP engineers?

First Unix shell is reverse polish.

Unix claimed the high ground for shell and programming language tools. Forth lost out. Making a comeback.

## Why R3ML?

As decribed in the following GitHub issue:

- https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/5269#issuecomment-622661995

- TLDR: The Tensor Flow (TFJS) Body Pix algorithm is already included in Jitsi-Meet.

As such, we may ask:

- Why hasn't anyone use TFJS Body Pix to extract the human body as avatar, to be used in an Augmented Reality conferencing app?

We suspect there are three primary reasons:

1. The good old learning curve to pick up a new framework / programming language (JavaScript React Redux).

2. Lack of a powerful live debugging system like Forth for new programmers to debug and learn the internal workings of Jitsi.

3. Both reasons above contribute to lack of documentation and manpower to prepare documentation, which lead to a positive feedback in difficulties in getting more developers.

Hence we hope R3ML will overcome these problems, perhaps enable thousands more developers to join our effort &mdash; ___Phoom: an augmented reality conferencing app___. 

The 3 problems mentioned above are not unique to Jitsi. They are perhaps generic to many other free software / open source projects.

- Why do we need that many developers for AR conferencing?

__We believe this is the beginning of a new era of computing:__

- _If the 2010 decade is defined by iPhone and Android mobile devices, then_ ___2020s should be the era of Virtual Reality &mdash; 3D VR AR___, _with opreating systems and devices that transcend the old, but the programming language has to be_ ___powerful___ _like Forth and yet_ ___easy to learn___ _like the Turtle graphics Logo programming language._

Hence ___Phoom R3ML___.

- Footnote: in figures 1 and 2, the camera is actually pointing at the monitor showing the browser console. _Can the program understand what it is seeing?_ We hope this will be a small step towards _Star Trek_ or _Star Wars_ &mdash; where Reverse Polish Notation opens up _homoiconic metaprogramming_, very likely the last mile towards achieving human level artificial intelligence. _But then that belongs to another article at another time._

Besides Forth implementations in other programming languages (from C/C++ to Lisp, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Haskell etc.) developed by other programmers, which we too classify as "stack machine shells" (smashlet), we ourselves have implemented Phoshell in:

- C, C++, PHP, Python, Java, JavaScript &mdash; on desktop Linux and Android (Java and NDK)
- Using Laravel Blade PHP, we succeeded in creating a Reverse Polish form of HTML!! &mdash; _a breakthrough perhaps as significant as the invention of HTML itself??_
- An attempt to implement raw Forth within Firefox JavaScript engine as a ___compatible___ alternative to WebAssembly
